# AndroidTVMovieMenu
Android TV app created as a learning exercise.  The app displays a series of movies from different years using <b>RxJava, Retrofit, MVVM, and Databinding </b>

Here's what I learned:
<ul>
<li>BackgroundManager and background layers</li>
<li>TV presenters and presenter selectors</li>
<li>TV app quality, navigation, and design principles</li>
<li>Overscan</li>
</ul>
